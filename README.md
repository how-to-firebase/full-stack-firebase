We've launched [Full-Stack Firebase on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/full-stack-firebase/?couponCode=FULLSTACK2018) for the full video experience.

The Udemy course features 2.5 hours of tightly-edited video walkthroughs. It is the absolute fastest, easiest way to learn Firebase. We've condensed everything on FullStackFirebase.com into video form with free instructor Q&A.

## GitBook vs GitHub

Read the GitBook or the GitHub repo:

* [GitBook](https://www.fullstackfirebase.com/): A luxurious reading experience
* [GitHub](https://github.com/how-to-firebase/full-stack-firebase): The delightful and gory details

## Beginners Welcome!

You'll need to know JavaScript. If you're weak on JavaScript... this may not be the course for you.

Check out the Prerequisites chapter for all of the details.

You don't need to know anything about Firebase to get started. Just be patient and move slowly through the material.

If you're already adept with Firebase, then please jump around! The more advanced modules later in the course will be of particular interest.

We'll cover integration for Angular and React. The Firebase SDK is all vanilla JavaScript, so if you can integrate with Angular and React, you should be able to integrate with any other modern framework.

## Modules

This course consists of a bunch of modules, including:

* Firebase Console
* Firebase Authentication
* Cloud Firestore
* Realtime Database
* Cloud Functions
* Firebase Storage
* Cloud Messaging
* Firebase Hosting

## Module Structure

Each module will have the following parts:

* Introduction
* Feature walk-through\(s\)
* Exercise\(s\)
* Downloadable notes

Some modules will build on each other, so skip around carefully 😉

## What to expect

* Opinionated code
* Angular and React integrations
* You'll need a Firebase account

We write opinionated code, and we like our courses opinionated as well.

If you're not familiar with Angular or React, do not worry. The markup and JavaScript is easy enough to read, and we'll stick to vanilla JS as much as possible.

Firebase's [free Spark plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) is **very generous**. Firebase Functions requires a paid Blaze plan _**IF**_ you want to make external HTTP calls. Otherwise, you can skate by on Spark.

## This course is not...

* 100% framework agnostic
* Exhaustive documentation
* Constantly updated

Firebase is framework-agnostic... but good luck writing a modern web application without some sort of templating framework.

We'll reference the [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) quite a bit throughout. We will try to duplicate them.

Firebase changes. A lot. The docs are canonical. Use them. We'll do our best to update this content, but staying 100% current would be a full-time job.
